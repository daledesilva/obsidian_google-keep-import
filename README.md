  <strong>Note:</strong>The plugin will likely work on older versions of Obsidian, however, these haven't been tested. If you have some reason to not be updating your Obsidian and it's not letting you install, you can either edit this plugin yourself or consider contacting me through the support section below.
</blockquote>

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
1. Install this plugin from the community plugins section of Obsidian's settings.
1. To export your files from Google Keep, open [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) and select only Google Keep files *(Depending on the amount of notes and attachments, this might take a while)*
2. Once you have the exported zip, unzip it so you have all the files separately.
3. In Obsidian, press `CMD+P` and select the `Google Keep Import` action.
3. In the modal that opens, drag in all the unzipped files and follow the instructions import the files.

## üéâ Features

### Error log
The plugin will always give you a real-time log of any files it is unable to import or that it believes aren't supported so that you can cancel the import immediately if needed, or find the files later to edit or convert.

### Imports binary files irrelevant of Keep notes
The plugin will import any binary files like images even if there isn't a corresponding Keep note. This means you can use the plugin as a batch import for a folder of files that didn't come from Keep if needed.

### Unsupported files
The plugin can import any file it sees regardless of whether ut cam from Keep or Obsidian supports it. You can turn this on if needed in the settings, but it's off by default and will let you know which file it skips.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customisable settings
The plugin provides a settings page that is also accessible during the import process. This allows you to tailor what gets imported and how dates, colours, tags, and more from the Keep files are treated in Obsidian.

  #### Basics
  - **Note import folder**: Defines the Obsidian folder where notes will be imported.
  - **Attachment import folder**: Defines the Obsidian folder where note attachments will be imported.
  - **Unsupported attachment import folder**: Defines the Obsidian folder where note attachments that aren't supported by Obsidian will be imported.
  - **Note creation date**: Defines which date should be used as the 'created on' date for each new Obsidian note; The date of Obsidian import, or the original Google Keep creation date.
  #### Inclusions
  Whether to import specific types of notes or ignore them.
  - **Import archived notes**
  - **Import trashed notes**
  - **Import unsupported files**:
    - **Import html files**:
    Unsupported (and html files) aren't imported by default as they will usually be invisible in Obsidian. HTML files from Google Takeout exports are also duplicates of other files so they do not need to be imported.
  #### Tags
  Whether to apply tags to notes in Obsidian to represent these attributes of the original Google Keep notes.
  - **Add label tags**
  - **Add colour tags**
  - **Add pinned tags**
  - **Add attachment tags**
  - **Add archived tags**
  - **Add trashed tags**
  #### Character Mapping
  Allows mapping any characters in titles to valid characters for use in your notes filenames. This is set to make files valid for all operating systems by default.
  - **Problem characters**
  These characters may not break the import, but the wil degrade functionality in certain places within Obsidian.
  - **Invalid characters**
  These characters in the titles of your imported notes can prevent import on certain operating systems.
