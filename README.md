  <strong>Note:</strong>The plugin will likely work on older versions of Obsidian, however, these haven't been tested. If you have some reason to not be updating your Obsidian and it's not letting you install, you can either edit this plugin yourself or consider contacting me through the support section below.
</blockquote>


#### Usage
1. Install this plugin from the community plugins section of Obsidian's settings.
1. To export your files from Google Keep, open [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) and select only Google Keep files *(Depending on the amount of notes and attachments, this might take a while)*
2. Once you have the exported zip, unzip it so you have all the files separately.
3. In Obsidian, press `CMD+P` and select the `Google Keep Import` action.
3. In the modal that opens, drag in all the unzipped files and follow the instructions import the files.

#### Features

**Error log**
The plugin will always give you a real-time log of any files it is unable to import or that it believes aren't supported so that you can cancel the import immediately if needed, or find the files later to edit or convert.

**Imports binary files irrelevant of Keep notes**
The plugin will import any binary files like images even if there isn't a corresponding Keep note. This means you can use the plugin as a batch import for a folder of files that didn't come from Keep if needed.

**Unsupported files**
By default, the plugin will import any file it sees regardless of whether Obsidian supports it. This is on by default to enable markdown file import (As those files erroneously weren't recognised during testing).

**Customisable settings**
The plugin provides a settings page that is also accessible during the import process. This allows you to tailor what gets imported and how dates, colours, tags, and more from the Keep files are treated in Obsidian.
