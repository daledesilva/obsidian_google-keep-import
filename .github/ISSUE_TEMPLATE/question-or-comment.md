>Please note that this plugin is no longer being maintained. However, I helped implement Google Keep Import into the official [Obsidian Importer](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-importer) plugin. Unless you need certain import customisations that this plugin offers, you should use that instead.

> If you have a question or a comment though, I'd be happy to hear from you.
