>Please note that this plugin is no longer being maintained. However, I helped implement Google Keep Import into the official [Obsidian Importer](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-importer) plugin. Unless you need certain import customisations that this plugin offers, you should use that instead.

> If you find a bug and want to warn others, please go ahead and post a report, however, because of the above, it's very unlikely it will be fixed.

**Describe the bug**

**Video or screenshots**

>You can capture a video fairly easily for free with an app called [Kap](https://getkap.co/) (Mac), or [Loom](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/loom-%E2%80%93-screen-recorder-sc/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb
) (Windows/Mac).
